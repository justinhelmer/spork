# spork
Stress-free node child process spawning and management. A small wrapper around [forever-monitor](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor)
with a simple interface.

Not everything has a `node` adapter. Often times, there is a need to spawn a child process to run another script (maybe even fork another `node` process).

Forking and managing [child processes](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) in `node` can prove challenging. If something fails in the pipe, you can be
left over with `phantom processes` running in the background. Over time, these can accumulate and result in strange issues such as blocked ports,
misbehaving debug tools, "random" exits, etc. Even a number of popular `node` modules, `grunt` plugins, etc. fail to exit cleanly. 

Additionally, the [child_process.spawn](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) interface is
not very desirable. It was written for flexibility, but the majority of the time it is used the same way. Managing all of this correctly across multiple
processes and multiple scripts can be cumbersome and error-prone.

To defer this redudancy and avoid the risk, `spork` was created to try to make spawning and forking smoother -- hence the name.

## Overview

`Spork` follows a very similar syntax to `node` core's [child_process.spawn](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options)
to keep the interface simple. It also takes advantage of the power of [forever-monitor](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor) to add some much-needed
robustness to the interface. The syntax should be straight-forward and familiar:

```js
const spork = require('spork');
spork(command, args, options);
```

Besides spawning child processes, `spork` can do a few other things:

 - manage and kill processes that fail - clean exits using [node-clean-exit](https://github.com/justinhelmer/node-clean-exit)
 - capture and/or act on `stdio` events
 - exit automatically on `failure` and/or `success` (configurable)
 - inherit parent stdio automatically, or suppress entirely
 - retain `ANSI` color character sequences through the pipe
 
## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save spork
```
 
## The interface

[Take me straight to the API](#spawncommand-argsoptions-options)

In its simplest form:

```js
spork('command', {exit: true}); // process will automatically exit when the command fails or succeeds
```

Normally, _all_ of this is required for just **one** process, in order to spawn it, act on data events, and exit cleanly:

```js
const done = async();

let child = spawn('command', ['--arg1', '--arg2'], {
  env: _.extend(process.env, {
    WHATEVER: 'isNeeded'
  }),

  stdio: [process.stdin, 'pipe', 'pipe']
});

child.stdout.setEncoding('utf8');
child.stderr.setEncoding('utf8');

child.stdout.on('data', function(data) {
  // .. do something
  
  process.stdout.write(data);
});

let errorBuffer = '';
child.stderr.on('data', function(data) {
  errorBuffer += data;
});

child.on('close', function(code) {
  if (code) {
    customErrorHandler(errorBuffer, code);
  } else {
    done();
  }
});

child.on('error', function(err) {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(99);
});

process.stdin.resume();

process.on('exit', exitHandler);
process.on('SIGINT', _.partial(exitHandler, {exitCode: 2}));
process.on('uncaughtException', _.partial(exitHandler, {exitCode: 99}));

function exitHandler(exitData, err) {
  if (err && err.stack) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  
  child.kill();

  if (exitData && exitData.exit) {
    process.exit(exitData.exit);
  }
}
```

Instead, just do this, to produce the same result:

```js
spork('command', ['--arg1', '--arg2'], {env: {WHATEVER: 'isNeeded'}})
    .on('stdout', function(data) {
      // .. do something
    })
    .on('exit', function(code) {
      // .. do something
      process.exit(code);
    });
```

Or, let `spork` handle everything:

```js
spork('command', ['--arg1', '--arg2'], {exit: true});
```

## spawn(command, [args|options], [options])

- @param **command** _{string}_ - The command to run.
- @param **[args]** _{mixed}_ - The arguments to pass to the command, as an _{array}_. Also can pass _{object}_ **[options]**
                                in this position and ignore **[args]**.
- @param **[options]** _{object}_ - Additional options to be passed to
                                    [forever-monitor](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor#options-available-when-using-forever-in-nodejs),
                                    plus custom options [below](#options).
- @returns _{[forever.monitor](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor)}_
- @see [child_process.spawn](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options)
- @see [forever-monitor](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor)

## Options

All options [here](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever-monitor#options-available-when-using-forever-in-nodejs), plus:
- **exit** _{mixed}_ - Close the child process on exit. Can be `success`, `failure`, `always`, `true` (alias for `always`), or `false`. Defaults to `failure`.
- **quiet** _{boolean}_ - Output nothing (suppress `STDOUT` and `STDERR`. Defaults to `false`.
- **stdio** _{array}_ - Identify whether or not to pipe `STDIN`, `STDOUT`, `STDERR` to the parent process. Defaults to `['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit']`.
- **verbose** _{mixed}_ - Output more. Can be a boolean or a number. The higher the number, the higher the verbosity. Defaults to `false`.
    
> You can completely nix the built-in `stdio` inheritence using `stdio: [null, null, null]` and manage it all yourself.
